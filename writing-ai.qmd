# On Writing in the Age of AI

## Writing as thinking and learning

Good writing **clarifies thought**. Writing is difficult because it forces us to confront our own thoughts, rationale, and reasoning. This is just one reason why writing is learning ([Zinsser, 1993](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Learn-William-Zinsser/dp/0062720406),[Yan, 2020](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/reading-note-taking-writing/), [Ahrens, 2022](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique/dp/3982438802/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_2/145-4544999-0238419?pd_rd_w=eF10d&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=FAD6C8DH6E4B0VVSGD1D&pd_rd_wg=ZARKE&pd_rd_r=5596127d-8f67-447e-9ac8-db82ff46caba&pd_rd_i=3982438802&psc=1)). Good writing is a feedback loop of multiple processes - reading, drafting, reflecting, reading, drafting, revising, revising, revising, revising, reflecting, writing, etc. In this course, writing is not a last-minute wrapper; it will be an integrated part of what we do, how we integrate, and how we think. Some of the writing may be AI assisted - and some of that will be your own (in which I will ask you to turn in an audit trail of reading notes and comments on our class [textbook wiki](https://umn-soil-5555-wiki.org)).

## What AI changes—and what it doesn’t

- AI can help you **brainstorm, outline, critique, and rephrase**.  
- AI cannot understand your specific field data, lab context, or instructor’s expectations unless **you** do.  
- **You are responsible** for factual accuracy, citations, and integrity.

> Our separate **AI Policy** covers boundaries (originality, attribution, and prohibited uses). This chapter focuses on practice.

## AI: tools vs. foundations

- **Foundation models** (e.g., general LLMs) learn broad patterns from massive data; **apps** (chatbots, copilots) wrap those models with UX and guardrails.  
- You should **know the difference** well enough to evaluate reliability, bias, and when to escalate to a human expert.
- We will use AI tools to **accelerate** thinking and learning—but not to *replace* reading, reasoning, or evidence.

## Required AI use log (attach with any assignment submissions where AI was used)

Include a brief section at the end of your assignment document as follows:

```
AI Use Log
- Models: (e.g., GPT-5, Claude, Gemini)
- Purpose(s): brainstorming, outline critique, code debugging, copyediting
- Prompts (or gist): 
- What I kept vs. discarded:
- Verification steps (how I checked claims / code):
- Date(s):
```

## A pragmatic workflow

1. **Define the deliverable** (audience, purpose, constraints).  
2. **Outline yourself**: produce a simple structure (thesis → sections → evidence).  
3. **Draft 0 with AI** (optional): ask for a **skeletal** outline or a list of counterarguments.  
4. **Write Draft 1 yourself**: fill sections using your results, figures, and citations.  
5. **Targeted AI passes**:  
   - “Point out unclear claims and missing evidence.”  
   - “Suggest stronger topic sentences for each paragraph.”  
   - “Propose 3 alternative figure captions grounded in the text.”  
6. **Fact-check & code-check**: run your analysis; verify numbers and references.  
7. **Polish**: style, transitions, title, abstract.

## On “prompt engineering” for writing

Much of modern writing with AI is **asking better questions**. You’ll get better results by being explicit about **tone, audience, structure, constraints**, and **evaluation criteria** (see the Prompt Engineering appendix).

## Citing AI influences

When AI meaningfully shapes a paragraph or figure, treat it like any other tool or collaborator: **acknowledge it** in the AI Use Log and ensure all **sources are properly cited**.

## Two podcast perspectives to consider

- On study craft and deliberate practice in the LLM era (and why “just reading” isn’t enough).  
- On transforming prompts into better prompts and using AI to build a reusable memory system.
