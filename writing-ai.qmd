## Writing as thinking

Good writing **clarifies thought**. In this course, writing is not a last-minute wrapper; it’s part of the analysis. Expect multiple drafts and targeted revisions.

## What AI changes—and what it doesn’t

- AI can help you **brainstorm, outline, critique, and rephrase**.  
- AI cannot understand your specific field data, lab context, or instructor’s expectations unless **you** do.  
- **You are responsible** for factual accuracy, citations, and integrity.

> Our separate **AI Policy** covers boundaries (originality, attribution, and prohibited uses). This chapter focuses on practice.

## Required AI use log (attach with submissions)

Include a brief section at the end of your Quarto document:

```
AI Use Log
- Models: (e.g., GPT-5, Claude, Gemini)
- Purpose(s): brainstorming, outline critique, code debugging, copyediting
- Prompts (or gist): 
- What I kept vs. discarded:
- Verification steps (how I checked claims / code):
- Date(s):
```

## A pragmatic workflow

1. **Define the deliverable** (audience, purpose, constraints).  
2. **Outline**: produce a simple structure (thesis → sections → evidence).  
3. **Draft 0 with AI** (optional): ask for a **skeletal** outline or a list of counterarguments.  
4. **Write Draft 1 yourself**: fill sections using your results, figures, and citations.  
5. **Targeted AI passes**:  
   - “Point out unclear claims and missing evidence.”  
   - “Suggest stronger topic sentences for each paragraph.”  
   - “Propose 3 alternative figure captions grounded in the text.”  
6. **Fact-check & code-check**: run your analysis; verify numbers and references.  
7. **Polish**: style, transitions, title, abstract.

## On “prompt engineering” for writing

Much of modern writing with AI is **asking better questions**. You’ll get better results by being explicit about **tone, audience, structure, constraints**, and **evaluation criteria** (see the Prompt Engineering appendix).

## Citing influences

When AI meaningfully shapes a paragraph or figure, treat it like any other tool or collaborator: **acknowledge it** in the AI Use Log and ensure all **sources are properly cited**.

## Two podcast perspectives to consider

- On study craft and deliberate practice in the LLM era (and why “just reading” isn’t enough).  
- On transforming prompts into better prompts and using AI to build a reusable memory system.
