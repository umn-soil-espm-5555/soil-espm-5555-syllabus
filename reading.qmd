## Why slow reading?

Rushing through technical material is a great way to *feel* informed and stay confused. We’ll practice **deliberate** reading: making the author’s argument visible, mapping terms, checking examples, and capturing questions.

## Two anchors

1. **Adler & Van Doren (1972), _How to Read a Book_.**  
   Key moves we’ll use:
   - **Inspectional reading** (skim to map the terrain; glossary, headings, figures).  
   - **Analytical reading** (distill the thesis; outline; define terms; test with examples).  
   - **Syntopical reading** (compare multiple sources on the same idea).

2. **Andy Matuschak’s practice (study session with Dwarkesh Patel).**  
   Techniques we’ll borrow:
   - Turn confusions into **explicit questions** (even before you know the answer).
   - Build **retrieval prompts** while you read (spaced repetition), not after.
   - Periodically **recite back** the argument in your own words to surface gaps.  
   *(See video link in References.)*

## Your reading audit trail (what you show)

Every assigned reading yields a **short artifact** you’ll submit with labs:

- **Zotero annotations**: highlights + marginal notes (exported or shared in a Zotero group).  
- **Outline** (bulleted): the section’s claim, evidence, definitions, and at least **3 questions** you generated.  
- **Concept map** (optional): terms and relationships.  
- **Two retrieval prompts** (Q→A pairs) you could review later.

> **Acceptable formats:**  
> - PDF with visible annotations, **or**  
> - Markdown export (Zotero → Notes → Copy as Markdown), **or**  
> - Screenshot series (if reading on paper) plus typed notes.

### Template (paste into your notes)

```
Reading: <citation>
Thesis (1–2 sentences):
Key definitions:
Evidence/examples:
I was confused by:
Connections to previous material:
2 retrieval prompts:
  - Q:
    A:
  - Q:
    A:
```

## How AI fits into reading

- Use an LLM to **clarify a passage** or **generate alternative examples**.  
- Do **not** accept paraphrases as understanding; respond in your own words and link back to the text.  
- Log AI assistance in your audit trail: model, prompt, and what you kept or discarded.

## Grading rubric (lightweight)

- **Complete trail** (annotations + outline + questions + prompts).  
- **Evidence of thinking** (your words, not just highlights).  
- **Specificity** (terms defined, claims stated; questions are concrete).  
- **Integrity** (AI use documented clearly).
