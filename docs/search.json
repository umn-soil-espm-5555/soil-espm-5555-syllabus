They do not drop from trees.\n\nTicks can carry human pathogens, prevalence is low, but important (Staph/Lymes).\nDeer ticks are much more likely to transmit than wood ticks.\nTicks need 24-36 hours after biting to transmit Lyme, so doing a good nightly tick check after a field day is important.\nDeet and permethrin applied to key areas/clothing items can also mitigate risk.",

    "text": "4.1 Assignments and Points (460 points)1\nField Trip Reports (45 points, 10% of your grade)\nYou will be required to write a brief report for three of the four field sessions. More specific details will be given before each field session. You will be working in groups on the field sessions and each group will turn in a single report. It should be well-written, clear and concise and follow standard format for soil profile descriptions. (3 reports x 15 points = 45 points).\nWeekly Lecture Quizzes (60 points, 13% of your grade)\nThere will be short, 5 question quizzes in lecture each week. These will typically be given on Wednesday, but can be taken the following Monday for credit in the case of an absence. These are learning assessments meant to understand how well concepts are being absorbed and understood in the class. These will be graded for completion, not accuracy (12 quizzes x 5 points = 60 points).\nAssignment 1: Biochemistry Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be given access to a simplified R shiny app which will allow you to adjust parameters and experiment with what happens to soil redox potential under different scenarios. This will allow you to further your understanding of the biochemical processes that lead to redox reactions in wet soils. You will turn in individual reports online, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 2: Redox Potential and Feature Project (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nWe will set up an experiment to monitor the formation of soil redoximorphic features and you will be provided data on changes in redox potential over several weeks. You may work in groups but turn in an individual report online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 3: Hydric Soils Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be given a set of soil profile descriptions and will determine if the soils are hydric or non-hydric and why. You will turn in individual reports online, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 4: Soil Hydrology Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be asked to interpret the type of hydrology for specified wetlands and interpret hydrologic monitoring date from piezometers and tensiometers. Independent work. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 5: Wetland Assessment Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will select an area of your choosing that contains significant hydric soils and will describe the nature of the wetlands and hydric soil conditions on site using publicly available digital resources such as Digital Elevation Models (and derivatives), the National Wetland Inventory, and . Independent work and turn in online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 6: Wetland Case Study (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will select a wetland type and location of interest to you and produce a 2 page technical summary of the soils, hydrology and vegetation of the wetland system. Independent work and turn in online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nGroup Hydric Soil Delineation Project (150 points, 33% of your grade)\nYour group (3-4 students) will be assigned a parcel of Rice Creek North Regional Trail Corridor land located to the north of the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in Shoreview. Your task will be to delineate all areas of hydric soils within your parcel of approximately 40 acres. Your group will flag the boundary in some sections (that I will field check); prepare a map of hydric soils; descriptions of upland, transitional, and hydric soils; and compile a comprehensive report for the site. Final projects will be due on Monday, December 8. We will provide aerial photographs and field equipment for this project and be available on certain dates to answer questions in the field. Your group will compile a single report including background information, soil profile data, landscape descriptions, general vegetation, presumed hydrology, and a map of the hydric soil boundary for your assigned parcel of land. You will use QGIS or ArcGIS to assist in the preparation of your final project and you will submit your project in an electronic pdf file. More details for the report will be provided in the laboratory session. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nMidterm Exam (50 points, 11% of your grade)\nMidterm exams will be timed (75 minutes) and given in-person in Room 375 Borlaug Hall.. If you have any questions regarding how your exam was graded, please make an appointment to see me or write down your question and return it to me with your original exam within one week after the exams are returned. Final course grades will be based on +/- system and adhere to the University Uniform Grading Standards. (2 midterm exams x 50 points = 100 points).\nSmall Group Activity/In-Class Wetland Assessment Proficiency (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nIn this small group activity and proficiency assessment, you will be assigned a location during our lab session and produce an initial technical report on the location by utilizing publicly available resources. Your technical report will be due by the end of the class session. (1 small group activity exam x 50 points = 50 points).\nFinal Comprehensive Exam (50 points, 11% of your grade)\nThe final exam will be comprehensive. (1 final exam x 50 points = 50 points).",

Per that policy:\n\nFor all academic sessions, courses, and modalities, hours of instructional time for a course must equal at least the number of credits for the course times 15 weeks in an academic term. 3 credits x 1 hour in class per credit (average) x 15 weeks = 45 hours of in-class instructional time.\nOne credit equals 3 hours of work per week (both in and out of class). So, a 3 credit class equals 3 credits x 3 hours/credit = 9 hours per week. 3 credits x 3 hours per week x 15 weeks = 135 hours total\n\nHere is how the course conforms:\n\n\n\nActivity\nNumber\nHours\n\n\n\n\nLectures*\n28\n28 x 0.84 = 24 hours\n\n\nAssignments*\n6\n6 x 5 = 30 hours\n\n\nLab/Field Sessions*\n7\n7 x 3 = 21 hours\n\n\nField Trip Reports*\n3\n3 x 3 = 9 hours\n\n\nHydric Soil Delin.
