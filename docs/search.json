These materials will also be printed and distributed in class when necessary for use. All distributed course materials will come three hole punched so it is recommended that you maintain a three-ring binder for this course.\nTextbook (Recommended Only) No textbook is required for this course. However, if you need a reference or if you are planning on continuing your work with and study of soils in the future, I recommend the text, which is available from most online booksellers. There are two versions of the recommended text, and many editions. The full version (more than 1,000 pages) is called The Nature and Properties of Soils by Ray Weil and Nyle Brady and is on its 15th Edition (2016 for hardcover/2022 for paperback). The abridged version is called Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils also by Ray Weil and Nyle Brady and is on its 4th Edition (2018). Note that the 15th edition of the full text and the 4th edition of the abridged text are the newest, but the previous 14th (full version) and 3rd (abridged version) editions work just as well and are generally much cheaper to purchase from online book sellers. The course schedule has recommended readings from the 4th edition of Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils or the 14th Edition (paperback) of The Nature and Properties of Soils:\nOR\nCourse Website: Lecture notes and other course materials will be available on the class website through Canvas.

We have designed the syllabus and schedule so that there is a regular “rhythm” to every week of the class. During a typical week, you will have a Pre-Discussion Quiz due on Canvas by Wednesday at 11:59PM, a live discussion session in 174 Plant Growth Facilities on Thursdays, and a Weekly Summary Quiz due by Friday at 11:59PM.\nYou will complete the lab at a time of your choosing between Wednesday and Friday each week. You’ll sign up for a lab timeslot during the first week of class. We hope that this helps structure your schedule and your interaction with the asynchronous lecture materials.\nCourse materials will be posted at least one week in advance, so you are free to work on a schedule that works best for you. If you engage with all of the lecture and lecture companion materials, attend discussion sections and lab at your chosen time, you will be very familiar with the material and should be successful in the class.\nCome to discussion prepared to participate! Unit summaries, zoom sessions, and additional materials on the Canvas site will provide you with the tools for success. We really look forward to meeting and working with you.\nYou are encouraged to ask any and all questions - even the “stupid” ones! (P.S. There are no stupid questions ;).",

    "text": "2.1 Assignments and Points (465 points)1\nField Trip Reports (45 points, 10% of your grade)\nYou will be required to write a brief report for three of the field trips. More specific details will be given before each field trip. You will be working in groups on the field trips and each group will turn in a single report. It should be well-written, clear and concise and follow standard format for soil profile descriptions. (3 reports x 15 points = 45 points).\nWeekly Lecture Quizzes (60 points, 13% of your grade)\nThere will be short quizzes in lecture each week. (12 quizzes x 5 points = 60 points).\nAssignment 1: Hydric Soils Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be given a set of soil profile descriptions and will determine if the soils are hydric or non-hydric and why. You will turn in individual reports online, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 2: Soil Hydrology Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be asked to interpret the type of hydrology for specified wetlands and interpret hydrologic monitoring date from piezometers and tensiometers. Independent work. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 3: Web Soil Survey Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will select an area of your choosing that contains significant hydric soils and will describe the nature of the wetlands and hydric soil conditions on site using Web Soil Survey (Digital Soil Survey). Independent work and turn in online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 4: Redox Potential and Feature Laboratory (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nWe will set up an experiment to monitor the formation of soil redoximorphic features and you will be provided data on changes in redox potential over several weeks. You may work in groups but turn in an individual report online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nGroup Hydric Soil Delineation Project (150 points, 32% of your grade)\nYour group (3-4 students) will be assigned a parcel of Rice Creek North Regional Trail Corridor land located to the north of the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in Shoreview. Your task will be to delineate all areas of hydric soils within your parcel of approximately 40 acres. Your group will flag the boundary in some sections (that I will field check); prepare a map of hydric soils; descriptions of upland, transitional, and hydric soils; and compile a comprehensive report for the site. Final projects will be due on Monday, December 8. We will provide aerial photographs and field equipment for this project and be available on certain dates to answer questions in the field. Your group will compile a single report including background information, soil profile data, landscape descriptions, general vegetation, presumed hydrology, and a map of the hydric soil boundary for your assigned parcel of land. You will use geographic information systems (GIS) technology to assist in the preparation of your final project and you will submit your project in an electronic pdf file. Joel Nelson will provide technical assistance, software, and a computer lab for this portion of the project, but each group should have someone who has had a GIS course. More details for the report will be provided in the laboratory session. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nMidterm Exams (100 points, 22% of your grade)\nMidterm exams will be timed (75 minutes) and given in-person in Room 375 Borlaug Hall.. If you have any questions regarding how your exam was graded, please make an appointment to see me or write down your question and return it to me with your original exam within one week after the exams are returned. Final course grades will be based on +/- system and adhere to the University Uniform Grading Standards. (2 midterm exams x 50 points = 100 points).\nFinal Comprehensive Exam (50 points, 11% of your grade)\nThe final exam will be comprehensive. (1 final exam x 50 points = 50 points).",

No curve will be applied. I do not oblige requests for grade “bump-ups” for extra credit at the end off the semester as these requests are not fair to your fellow students and against University policy. However, I do calculate everybody’s final grade with a 0.5% grace. So, in other words, if you are within 0.5% of the next grade category you will receive the higher grade. Be proud of the grade you earned!\n\n\n2.2.3 Grading Challenges\nAny challenges to graded assignments you wish to be considered should be emailed to the instructor within one week of the posting date of the graded item.\n\n\n2.2.4 Student Workload Statement\nThis course conforms to the UMN expected time per course credit policy.) Per that policy:\n\nFor all academic sessions, courses, and modalities, hours of instructional time for a course must equal at least the number of credits for the course times 15 weeks in an academic term. 3 credits x 1 hour in class per credit (average) x 15 weeks = 45 hours of in-class instructional time.\nOne credit equals 3 hours of work per week (both in and out of class). So, a 3 credit class equals 3 credits x 3 hours/credit = 9 hours per week. 3 credits x 3 hours per week x 15 weeks = 135 hours total\n\nHere is how the course conforms:\n\n\n\nActivity\nNumber\nHours\n\n\n\n\nLectures*\n29\n29 x 1 = 29 hours\n\n\nAssignments*\n4\n4 x 6 = 24 hours\n\n\nLab/Field Sessions*\n7\n7 x 3 = 21 hours\n\n\nField Trip Reports*\n3\n3 x 3 = 9 hours\n\n\nHydric Soil Delin.
