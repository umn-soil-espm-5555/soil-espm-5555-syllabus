More specific details will be given before each field session. You will be working in groups on the field sessions and each group will turn in a single report. It should be well-written, clear and concise and follow standard format for soil profile descriptions. (3 reports x 15 points = 45 points).\nWeekly Reading Annotations, Wiki Audit Trail, and Lecture Quizzes (60 points, 13% of your grade)\nEach week, you will be asked to conduct There will be short, 5 question quizzes in lecture each week. These will typically be given on Wednesday, but can be taken the following Monday for credit in the case of an absence. These are learning assessments meant to understand how well concepts are being absorbed and understood in the class. These will be graded for completion, not accuracy (12 quizzes x 5 points = 60 points).\nAssignment 1: Biochemistry Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be given access to a simplified R shiny app which will allow you to adjust parameters and experiment with what happens to soil redox potential under different scenarios. This will allow you to further your understanding of the biochemical processes that lead to redox reactions in wet soils. You will turn in individual reports online, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 2: Redox Potential and Feature Project (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nWe will set up an experiment to monitor the formation of soil redoximorphic features and you will be provided data on changes in redox potential over several weeks. You may work in groups but turn in an individual report online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 3: Hydric Soils Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be given a set of soil profile descriptions and will determine if the soils are hydric or non-hydric and why. You will turn in individual reports online, but may work together if you like. (1 assignment x 10 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 4: Soil Hydrology Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be asked to interpret the type of hydrology for specified wetlands and interpret hydrologic monitoring data from piezometers and tensiometers. Independent work. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 5: Wetland Assessment Exercise (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will be provided with an area that contains significant hydric soils and will describe the nature of the wetlands and hydric soil conditions on site using publicly available digital resources such as Digital Elevation Models (and derivatives), the National Wetland Inventory, and . Independent work and turn in online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nAssignment 6: Wetland Case Study (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nYou will select a wetland type and location of interest to you and produce a 2 page technical summary of the soils, hydrology and vegetation of the wetland system. Independent work and turn in online. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nGroup Hydric Soil Delineation Project (150 points, 33% of your grade)\nYour group (3-4 students) will be assigned a parcel of Rice Creek North Regional Trail Corridor land located to the north of the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in Shoreview. Your task will be to delineate all areas of hydric soils within your parcel of approximately 40 acres. Your group will flag the boundary in some sections (that I will field check); prepare a map of hydric soils; descriptions of upland, transitional, and hydric soils; and compile a comprehensive report for the site. Final projects will be due on Monday, December 8. We will provide aerial photographs and field equipment for this project and be available on certain dates to answer questions in the field. Your group will compile a single report including background information, soil profile data, landscape descriptions, general vegetation, presumed hydrology, and a map of the hydric soil boundary for your assigned parcel of land. You will use QGIS or ArcGIS to assist in the preparation of your final project and you will submit your project in an electronic pdf file. More details for the report will be provided in the laboratory session. (1 assignment x 15 points = 15 points).\nMidterm Exam (50 points, 11% of your grade)\nMidterm exams will be timed (75 minutes) and given in-person in Room 375 Borlaug Hall.. If you have any questions regarding how your exam was graded, please make an appointment to see me or write down your question and return it to me with your original exam within one week after the exams are returned. Final course grades will be based on +/- system and adhere to the University Uniform Grading Standards. (2 midterm exams x 50 points = 100 points).\nSmall Group Activity/In-Class Wetland Assessment Proficiency (15 points, 3% of your grade)\nIn this small group activity and proficiency assessment, you will be assigned a location during our lab session and produce an initial technical report on the location by utilizing publicly available resources. Your technical report will be due by the end of the class session. (1 small group activity exam x 50 points = 50 points).\nFinal Comprehensive Exam (50 points, 11% of your grade)\nThe final exam will be comprehensive. (1 final exam x 50 points = 50 points).",

    "text": "A.2 What these tools are (and why we use them)\n\nA.2.1 R\nR is a programming language designed for data analysis, statistics, and graphics. We’ll use it to wrangle messy datasets, analyze experiments, and make publication-quality figures. You will write clean, reproducible code so your work can be re-run months later.\n\nCore packages we’ll use: tidyverse (data wrangling, plotting), sf (vector geospatial), terra (rasters), janitor (clean tables), here (project paths).\n\n\n\nA.2.2 RStudio (Posit)\nAn IDE that makes R friendlier: script editor, console, plots, environment pane, projects, Git integration, and Quarto authoring. Think of it as “mission control” for the class.\n\n\nA.2.3 Quarto\nA publishing system to create notebooks, reports, slides, books, and websites from code and markdown. You’ll submit analyses as .qmd documents that combine prose, code, and figures. (It’s the evolution of R Markdown.)\n\n\nA.2.4 Git + GitHub\nProfessional science = version control. Git records changes; GitHub lets you: - collaborate with teammates, - open issues / code review, - share reproducible projects.\nWe’ll use feature branches and frequent commits with clear messages.\n\n\nA.2.5 Zotero (+ Connector)\nYour second brain for papers. We’ll use Zotero to: - collect readings and PDFs, - annotate (highlights/notes), - export citations to Quarto, - keep a reading audit trail (see the Reading appendix).\n\n\nA.2.6 QGIS\nWe’ll use QGIS for quick exploratory mapping, geoprocessing, and cross-checking R outputs. If you’re new to GIS, QGIS gives you a visual entry point that complements R’s scripted workflows.\n\n\nA.2.7 Large Language Models (LLMs)\nYou’ll learn to use an LLM as a reading companion, coding assistant, and writing aid. We’ll practice effective prompting and documentation of AI use (see Writing & AI and Prompt Engineering appendices). Free tiers are sufficient.",

    "text": "C.6 Futureproof habits (adapted from Kevin Roose)\nKevin Roose’s Futureproof lays out nine rules for thriving alongside automation. Below I’ve reframed them for this class—tying each to how we’ll learn and work in SOIL/ESPM 5555.\n\nBe surprising, social, and scarce. Double down on the parts machines don’t do well—explaining decisions, collaborating, teaching, designing visuals, telling the story behind the data.\nCourse lens: pair programming, quick stand-ups, short oral briefings, and figure-first writing in Quarto.\nResist machine drift. Feeds and defaults nudge you to the median. We push back with slow, deliberate reading and independent checks.\nCourse lens: annotated reading with an audit trail; compare model output to primary sources and notebooks.\nDemote your devices. Use tech intentionally, not reflexively.\nCourse lens: focus blocks in lab; notifications off; do-not-disturb during field work and code reviews.\nLeave handprints. Don’t just work hard—work recognizably human.\nCourse lens: commentary cells that explain why not just what; defensible design choices; commit messages with reasoning.\nDon’t be an endpoint. If your role is only relaying between tools, you’re easy to automate.\nCourse lens: own the pipeline—from field plan → data → analysis → interpretation → decision; integrate field, data, and theory.\nTreat AI like a “chimp army.” Powerful but messy—useful with clear instructions and supervision.\nCourse lens: prompt scaffolds, verification checklists, and an AI Use Log for every assignment (what you asked, what it produced, how you verified).\nBuild big nets and small webs. Systems and communities matter.\nCourse lens: peer reviews, GitHub issues, and posting MREs (minimal reproducible examples) when stuck; practice being the teammate people want.\nLearn the machine-age humanities. Attention, judgment, ethics, “room reading,” and healthy skepticism are technical skills now.\nCourse lens: assess uncertainty, cite responsibly, narrate limitations and downstream effects in every substantial brief.\nSupport the rebels. Back people improving tech’s ethics and transparency.\nCourse lens: raise tradeoffs (privacy, bias, externalities) in project pitches; know the difference between foundation models and the apps built on them.\n\n\nHow this fits our philosophy: In an era where you “can’t afford to not do computers,” these habits turn AI into leverage rather than a crutch. They raise expectations for college-level work, prepare you for a workforce where tools change weekly, and align with our growth mindset: curious, adaptive, and continually leveling up. Bring the tools on day one; bring the mindset every day.\n\n\nC.6.1 References\n\nRoose, K. (2021/2022). Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation. Random House.\n\nHuth, A.

Good writing is a feedback loop of multiple processes - reading, drafting, reflecting, reading, drafting, revising, revising, revising, revising, reflecting, writing, etc. In this course, writing is not a last-minute wrapper; it will be an integrated part of what we do, how we integrate, and how we think.
