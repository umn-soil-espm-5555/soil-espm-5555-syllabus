> **TL;DR for Day 1**  
> Please arrive with everything in the checklist below installed and working. Bring your laptop.

## Day 1 setup checklist

- **[R (≥ 4.3) and R Studio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)** — base language for data analysis in this class and IDE for R. 
- **Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account** with your umn.edu email address. Additionally, download the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) app.
- **[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)** + **[Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors)** (browser) — reference manager & PDF annotation. **IMPORTANT: create a Zotero account with your umn.edu email address. Download the Zotero Desktop app.**
- **At least one LLM account** (your choice) — e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Co-Pilot. Free tiers are fine. UMN offers enterprise level access to [Google Gemini](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/gemini-enterprise-grade-data-protection) and [Microsoft Co-Pilot](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/copilot-enterprise-data-protection) (which is built on GPT).
- **[QGIS](https://qgis.org) (3.x)** — open-source GIS.  
- *(Optional but useful)* **[VS Code - Mac and PC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [BBEdit - Mac only](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html)** (for raw text editing), **Obsidian** (for a personal knowledge base).

## What these tools are (and why we use them)

### R
R is a programming language designed for **data analysis, statistics, and graphics**. We’ll use it to wrangle messy datasets, analyze experiments, and make publication-quality figures. You will write clean, **reproducible** code so your work can be re-run months later.

- Core packages we’ll use: **tidyverse** (data wrangling, plotting), **sf** (vector geospatial), **terra** (rasters), **janitor** (clean tables), **here** (project paths).

### RStudio (Posit)
An IDE that makes R friendlier: script editor, console, plots, environment pane, projects, Git integration, and **Quarto** authoring. Think of it as “mission control” for the class.

### Zotero (+ Connector)
Your **second brain for papers**. We’ll use Zotero to:
- collect readings and PDFs,
- **annotate** (highlights/notes),
- export citations to Quarto,
- keep a **reading audit trail** (see the Reading appendix).

### QGIS
We’ll use QGIS for quick exploratory mapping, geoprocessing, and cross-checking R outputs. If you’re new to GIS, QGIS gives you a visual entry point that complements R’s scripted workflows.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
You’ll learn to use an LLM as a **reading companion, coding assistant, and writing aid**. We’ll practice **effective prompting** and **documentation of AI use** (see Writing & AI and Prompt Engineering appendices). Free tiers are sufficient.

## How we’ll use this stack

- **Reproducible analysis**: R + Quarto notebooks for labs & projects.
- **Versioned projects**: Git/GitHub for collaboration and accountability.
- **Reading workflow**: Zotero to annotate; export notes; connect to wiki citations.
- **Geospatial**: QGIS for inspection; R for scripted pipelines.
- **AI assistance**: LLMs for scaffolding ideas, debugging code, and generating *first-pass* outlines—**with clear attribution/logs**.

> **Mindset**: You don’t have to be a “programmer” to succeed here, but you **cannot afford** to avoid computational tools. We will learn them together, step by step.
