## Recommended Habits for Success in this Class

Regular participation is key in this course! 

Course materials will be posted at least one week in advance, so you are free to work on a schedule that works best for you. If you engage with all of the lecture and lecture companion materials, and attend required lab sessions, you will be very familiar with the material and should be successful in the class. 

Come to class prepared to participate! This is a graduate level class and will challenge all of us in a positive way. The more you engage, the more you will get out of the course! I really look forward to meeting and working with you. 

**You are encouraged to ask any and all questions - even the "stupid" ones! (P.S. There are no stupid questions ;).**
